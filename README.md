# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pavel

I'm a backend developer with a passion for building scalable and efficient solutions using modern technologies. My primary focus is on **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Nest.js**, with additional experience in **C#** for specific projects.

## ðŸš€ What I Do

- **Backend Development**: Crafting robust APIs and backend systems.
- **Node.js & TypeScript**: Developing scalable and maintainable applications with TypeScript and Node.js.
- **Nest.js**: Leveraging the power of Nest.js for creating modular and testable server-side applications.
- **C#**: Occasionally diving into C# for certain projects, bringing a multi-language approach to problem-solving.
- **Frontend Development**: Experience with **React** and **Vite** for building fast and responsive user interfaces.
- **Design Patterns**: Familiar with architectural patterns like **Microservices**, **MVC**, **MVVM**, **Monolithic Architecture** and **Layered Architecture**, which I apply in different projects to ensure clean and maintainable codebases.
- **Security**: Worked with **JWT** for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Web Servers**: Knowledge of **Nginx** for configuring and optimizing web server performance.
